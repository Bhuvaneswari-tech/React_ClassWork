Case Study: Feedback Form in a Learning Management System (LMS)

Scenario
A company provides online training through its Learning Management System (LMS). 
After every training session, learners are asked to submit feedback. 

The company wants to build a feedback form in React with the following requirements:
Required Field Validation
Fields like Name, Email, Feedback message, and Rating must not be left blank.
Format Validation
Email should follow a valid format (e.g., name@example.com).
Phone number (if collected) should contain only digits and be of standard length.
Length Validation
Feedback message should be at least 20 characters and a maximum of 250 characters.
Pattern Validation
Name should only contain alphabets and spaces.
Phone number (if applicable) must follow a 10-digit pattern.

Approach Using React Hooks
useState for Form Management
Each input field (name, email, feedback message, rating) will have a state variable.
An errors state object will be used to store validation error messages dynamically.
Validation Rules
On form submit, each field will be validated:
Required check (e.g., if (!name) show error "Name is required").
Format check using regular expressions (for email, phone, etc.).
Length check for feedback message.
Pattern check for name and phone number.
useEffect for Real-time Validation
As the user types, useEffect can re-check specific fields (like email format, message length) and update errors immediately.
Form Submission
If all validations pass (errors object is empty), the form data will be submitted to a backend API (e.g., storing in database or sending via email).
Otherwise, error messages will be displayed below respective fields.

Outcomes
Positive Experience for Learners: Users get instant feedback if they type wrong values (e.g., invalid email).
Better Quality of Data: Training team receives clean, properly formatted feedback.
